# NeuralEmotion
This repository contains an implementation of sentiment analysis models using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) for predicting election outcomes based on sentiment analysis of social media data. 
The sentiment analysis models utilize CNN and RNN architectures to capture both local and sequential dependencies in textual data. The CNN component is responsible for extracting local features and patterns from the input text, while the RNN component captures the sequential information and long-term dependencies.
The trained models in this repository are specifically designed to analyze sentiment in social media data related to elections. By processing a large volume of tweets, posts, or comments, the models can identify the sentiment polarity (positive, negative, or neutral) associated with political candidates, parties, or specific election-related topics.
This repository includes pre-processing scripts for cleaning and preparing the data, as well as training and evaluation scripts for the CNN and RNN models. It also provides sample datasets to demonstrate the model's performance. The code is written in a popular deep learning framework such as TensorFlow or PyTorch and includes clear instructions for setting up the environment and running the experiments.
The aim of this repository is to provide a framework for researchers and data scientists to explore the application of sentiment analysis using CNN and RNN models for predicting election outcomes based on social media sentiment. It serves as a starting point for further research and experimentation in this domain.
